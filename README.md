# MoviesApp-v2
MoviesApp-v2 is an upgraded version of the MoviesApp I built before, showcasing Clean Architecture principles, the Repository Pattern, and MVVM pattern. It incorporates the latest Navigation Architecture Component and Bottom Navigation view, allowing for easy and intuitive navigation with separate back stack history for each tab.

Built using Hilt, Kotlin Coroutines, and Room, MoviesApp-v2 demonstrates the seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies. Hilt enables flexible and modular development through dependency injection, while Kotlin Coroutines ensures smooth and efficient handling of async operations. Room simplifies local data storage for enhanced performance.
